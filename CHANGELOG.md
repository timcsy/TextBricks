## [0.1.7] - 2025-01-XX

### üß† Smart Indentation System - Major Overhaul

#### Added
- **Unified Indentation System**: Complete rewrite with single `formatCodeSnippetUnified` method handling all insertion scenarios

- **Smart Cursor Analysis**: Empty line detection prevents unnecessary indentation when inserting at line start (column 0)
- **Template-Assisted Recovery**: Automatic recovery of lost indentation information using original template context
- **Comprehensive Test Suite**: Full test coverage for all indentation scenarios and edge cases

#### Changed
- **Consistent Insertion Behavior**: Tooltip and documentation insertions now use identical logic, eliminating inconsistencies
- **Provider Unification**: Both `WebviewProvider` and `DocumentationProvider` use the same formatting method
- **Improved Algorithm**: Enhanced same-level detection with better handling of mixed indentation scenarios

#### Fixed
- **Indentation Inconsistency**: Fixed bug where tooltip insertions and documentation insertions behaved differently
- **Empty Line Handling**: Fixed excessive indentation when inserting code at the start of empty lines
- **Selection Recovery**: Fixed issue where selected text from documentation lost proper indentation context

#### Technical Improvements
- **Code Duplication Elimination**: Unified codebase with single source of truth for indentation logic
